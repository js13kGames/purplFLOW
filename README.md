# purplFLOW
PurplFLOW is a VR action shooter game inspired by [SUPERHOT](https://superhotgame.com "Time moves when you move") made for the [js13kGames competition](https://js13kgames.com "Annual competition with plenty of prizes. Want to participate?") with the [A-Frame library](https://aframe.io "A-Frame") for WebVR developed by [Mozilla®](https://mozilla.org "Non-profit dedicated to protecting the Internet"). You can also see the Glitch project of purplFLOW [here](https://purplflow.glitch.me "The Glitch project for purplFLOW"), where you can remix the game into your own version.
