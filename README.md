# purplFLOW
PurplFLOW is a VR action shooter game inspired by [SUPERHOT](https://superhotgame.com "Time moves when you move") made for the [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com "Annual competition with plenty of prizes. Want to participate?") game competition with the [A-Frame open-source](https://aframe.io "A-Frame") library for WebVR developed by [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org "Non-profit dedicated to protecting the Internet"). See more about it, including controls and how to play at <http://purplFLOW.pen.io>. You can also see the Glitch project [here](https://purplflow.glitch.me "The Glitch project for purplFLOW, where you can remix the game").

6. Put your headset on and have fun!

## No VR
Don't worry, even if you don't have VR or don't have a compatible headset, you can still play purplFLOW without a VR experience. On a desktop PC or laptop, you can use your keyboard and mouse to move, look around and shoot (with W, A, S, D keys, mouse and left mouse button). On mobile, you can move your view by moving the phone and shoot by tapping on the screen.

## Pair a controller
1. Go to your device's Settings
2. Enable Bluetooth
3. Activate the controller's pairing mode ([how?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQxkk1VuCyE "Simple YouTube tutorial for pairing most controllers to a device"))
4. Select the controller from the Bluetooth devices Search list
5. Now you have a paired controller!
