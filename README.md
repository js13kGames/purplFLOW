1. Go to your device's settings
2. Enable Bluetooth
3. Activate the controller's pairing mode ([how?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQxkk1VuCyE "Simple YouTube tutorial for pairing most controllers to a device"))
4. Select the controller from the Bluetooth devices Search list
5. Now you have a paired controller!
