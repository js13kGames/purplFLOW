# purplFLOW
PurplFLOW is a VR action shooter game inspired by [SUPERHOT](https://superhotgame.com "Time moves when you move") made for the [js13kGames competition](https://js13kgames.com "Annual competition with plenty of prizes. Want to participate?") with the [A-Frame library](https://aframe.io "A-Frame") for WebVR developed by [Mozilla®](https://mozilla.org "Non-profit dedicated to protecting the Internet"). The Glitch project of purplFLOW is available [here](https://purplflow.glitch.me "The Glitch project for purplFLOW"), where you can play and remix the game into your own version.

## Oculus Rift
3. Connect your Oculus Rift to your PC or laptop ([need help setting it up?](https://support.oculus.com/guides/rift/latest/concepts/rgsg-1-sw-software-setup/#rgsg-1-sw-software-setup "Oculus Rift Support Article"))

## No VR
Don't worry, even if you don't have VR or a compatible headset, you can still play purplFLOW without a VR experience. On a desktop PC or laptop, you can use your keyboard and mouse to move, look around and shoot (with W, A, S, D keys, mouse and left mouse button). On mobile, if your phone or tablet has a gyroscope, you can look around by rotating the phone to have the whole 360° experience; otherwise, you can still move your view with your finger, and shoot by tapping on the screen.

## Pair a controller
1. Go to your device's settings
2. Enable Bluetooth
3. Activate the controller's pairing mode ([need help? [YouTube tutorial]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQxkk1VuCyE "Simple YouTube tutorial for pairing most controllers to a device"))
4. Select your controller from the available devices list
5. Now you have a paired controller!

Don't have a Bluetooth-enabled controller? If it has USB, you can still connect it to your device through USB with a Micro/Mini USB to USB cable and a special USB Port to Micro USB/USB Type C adapter, depending on your controller's and your device's ports. You can use a simple charger cable and find an adapter at a retail store or online.
